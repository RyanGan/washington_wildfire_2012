# General approach to producing population-weighted zipcode-specific PM2.5 -----

# The best thing to do is mutiply the population grid by the concentration
# matrices first, which I believe should give you the population weighted
# concentrations for each grid (dim should be 1107 by 126 I think). Then take
# that matrix and multiply by zipcode by grid matrix to get the population
# weighted concentration for each grid, which I can then divide by
# the zip_pop_matrix to get the zip code specific population weighted average.

# this gives me a matrix of the sum of values for each zipcode for each day

# now I think each daily value of this matrix needs to be divided by
# the summed population of each zip code
# need to multiply by the inverse of the zip_pop_vector for each column 
# since you cannot divide with matrix algebra
