### Overview

This GitHub repository contains R code and some files relevant to the NASA wildfire smoke project and is specific to our work on assessing the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and hospital-related morbidity in Washington State during the 2012 wildfire season. This Git repository contains code and some data used in the manuscript "Comparison of wildfire smoke estimation methods and associations with cardiopulmonary-related hosptial admissions" found online and opensource here: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GH000073/full.

This project uses protected health information (i.e. admission date of a patient and reported ZIP code) covered by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. Therefore, Washington Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) data are not available due to data use agreements with Washington State Health Department.
